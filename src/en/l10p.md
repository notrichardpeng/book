# L10P

This chapter is about solving the Last 10 Pieces (L10P), which is divided into CMLL and Last Six Edges (LSE). We'll cover the algorithms, fingertricks, and various efficiency techniques that will help you succeed in this second part of Roux.

## General Information
CMLL
- There are only 42 cases in CMLL, which isn't bad to learn compared to OLL + PLL in CFOP. See it as a motivation to begin learning full CMLL now! 


- Since the M slice is free in Roux, R-wide moves are incorporated in CMLL algorithms, sometimes producing more efficient solutions to the cases.

LSE
- LSE is 2-gen, meaning that only two kinds of moves are needed to solve this step, namely M and U moves. This gives a great advantage to one-handed solving.


- LSE is intuitive. Avoid learning it by brute-force memorizing to make your life easier.

## Transitioning from CMLL to LSE
For high-level solvers, a fast transition from CMLL to LSE is a key to faster solves. We'll discuss ways to improve this transition.
