# CMLL

## Recognition Method: From beginner's 4-tile to all angles

CMLL recognition is a little more tricky than something like OLL. Not only does one have to pay attention to the orinetation of the corners, one also has to pay attention to their colors. Despite that, an advanced Roux solver is able to recognize the CMLL case within fractions of a second. Here is the progression towards that.

### I. Beginner Recognition

A beginner most likely uses 2-look CMLL, so it is mostly irrelevant for them to pay attention to the colors of the corners. It is adequate to simply get used to recognizing the orientation of the corners.

Practice recognizing the corner orientations fast - this will definitely come in handy later on.

### II. Partial/Full CMLL

Now that you have learned specific cases of CMLL, you are forced to pay attention to the colors of the corners. Practice recognizing these cases too. In addition, make sure you know beforehand which angles you should rotate to in order to see the corner colors. Keep in mind, you are only rotating the with `U` moves, not full cube rotations.

Rotations in recognition can be easily reduced by knowing how to peek to the side. Peeking is when you are 90&deg; off from an angle where you can see all corner colors, you slightly tilt your cube to the left/right to see them. This can save at least one move.
