## M2 EOLRb 4C Influencing

The following solutions are for specific cases where EOLRb will be solved with an `M2` and 4C is a non-cycle case. Influencing begins when EO is solved and only one LR edge is on the bottom; both LR edges are then placed on the bottom in a way that results in a shorter 4C. They either:
- skip the dots case, resulting in a 4C skip,
- or end up with a 3 mover 4C (`M2 U2 M2` after AUF'ing) instead of some 5 mover (e.g. `M' U2 M2 U2 M`).

## EOLR Progression

It is not recommended to memorize algsheets for EOLR.
